## What is Compendia
Compendia is a **decentralized network** where anyone can create and contribute to **open databases** in any category. Apps and services can use these databases within their service for free. 

Think of Compendia an *oracle network* (feeding data from the internet to a blockchain), but instead of serving *one piece* of data for *one* specific topic, the network can serve ***full databases*** relating to ***any topic***.

You can also think of Compendia as the *Wikipedia of databases* for apps, services, blockchains, smart contracts, IoT, A.I. and more. 


### Use Cases
Any service that processes databases (meaning: almost any application on the internet) can benefit from free, open data.
* **App store** where all apps are maintained by users and validators on Compendia.
* **DeFi** (Decentralized Finance) application that pulls cryptocurrency price data from Compendia.
* Video streaming service that displays trending videos uploaded to a video-database on Compendia. 
* Training **Artificial Intelligence** by feeding it data from Compendia.
* Wiki service that formats and displays encyclopedia-like data of a specific category.

### Adoption
We're still building the tools that allow developers to easily integrate the network's databases within their apps.

The first application to integrate a Compendia database is the nOS multi-blockchain wallet app:

|   Name                  | Description        | Database     |
| ------------------------|:-------------------|:-------------| 
| [nOS](https://nos.io)   | Crypto App Store   | crypto_apps  |

## Dia Coin

|   Name      |  Symbol   | Ticker  |
| ------------|----------|---------| 
| Dia         | ₵         | DIA     |

Dia is the Compendia blockchain's native cryptocurrency. Coins represent **Vote Power** - or ***Power*** - on the network (1 DIA = 1 Power). This Power lets Dia holders vote for validators. (Ex.: a wallet with ₵10.00 is worth 10 votes when they vote for a validator, but Dia can be *staked* to be worth up to 10x more Power).

The top **forty-seven** validators on the network with the most votes forge blocks and earn block rewards and transaction fees.

Validators can upload **databases** according to any registered **database schema**. These databases can then be used collectively by third-party services such as app stores, video sites, and other content sharing platforms, for free.

The services that use these databases can also use the validators' **rank** or **vote count** to measure how the data should be ranked and represented on their services.

DIA is **not spent** on voting (apart from a small transaction fee when setting a vote). Instead, the voting power of a Dia wallet is calculated by its DIA **balance and stake**.

### Staking
 DIA holders can **lock** DIA in their wallet for a set period of time to increase their vote weight without extra costs. This is called **staking**. For example: 10,000 DIA staked for 3 months equals 50,000 Vote Power, instead of 10,000 Vote Power when left un-staked.
