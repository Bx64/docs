# Creating a Validator

This guide will teach you how to register a validator and set up a validator profile using the Compendia Web Wallet.

## Register a Validator

*If you only want to launch relay nodes you can skip registering a validator.*

1. Open [nOS Web Wallet](https://wallet.nos.dev)

2. Log in with your mnemonic key, or create a new wallet.
**Make sure to store your mnemonic key in a safe and secure location!**

3. Make sure you have at least 100 coins in your wallet. 
If you're on the public testnet, you can click **Get coins** to get free coins (You can request free coins once every 3 days):

Logos and descriptions are visible on the wallet and explorer.
