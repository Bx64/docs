# Introduction

## What is Compendia
Compendia is a **decentralized network** where anyone can create and contribute to **open databases** of any category *(e.g. apps, markets, cryptocurrencies, music, videos, games, data, etc)*. Apps and services can pull the data from these databases for free. The supply and demand for contributing to these databases create an **open data economy**.  

Think of Compendia an *oracle network* (feeding data from the internet to a blockchain), but instead of serving *one piece* of data for *one* specific topic, the network can serve ***full databases*** from ***many sources*** relating to ***any topic***.

You can also think of Compendia as the *Wikipedia of databases* for apps, services, blockchains, smart contracts, IoT, A.I. and more. 

## Dia Coin

| Name | Symbol | Ticker |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Dia  | â‚µ      | DIA    |

Dia is the Compendia blockchain's native cryptocurrency. Dia represents **Vote Power**  (or *Power*) on the network (1 Dia = 1 Power). With Vote Power, you can vote for **validators** (the *miners* of the network). 

The top **forty-seven** validators on the network with the most votes *mine blocks*, which means they verify transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees in return.

Validators also have the ability to upload **databases** to Compendia. These databases can then be used by apps and services for free.

The apps using these databases can rank their items by measuring the vote power of the validator that uploaded it. Therefore, the Dia coin not only influences *forging positions* of validators, but also *database item positions*.

Dia is **not spent** on voting (apart from a small transaction fee when setting a vote). Instead, the voting power of a Compendia wallet consists of the total sum of its **balance and stake**.

See how the network's economy and the Dia Coin work at the [Economy](./economy.html) section.

### Staking
 You can **lock** Dia in you wallet for a set period of time to increase you voting power without extra costs. This is called **staking**.
 
 For example: 10,000 Dia normally represents 10,000 vote power. If you stake these Dia for 3 months, their vote power increases to 50,000 for that duration.

There are various features and levels with staking.

To find out more, see the [Economy - Staking](./economy.html#staking) section.


### Earning Dia

Dia is available on several exchanges, but there are also ways that you can **earn Dia** by participating in the ecosystem:

* **Stake and vote:** You can vote for a validator on Compendia and benefit from the services and rewards that they may offer to voters. Some validators choose to share a fixed percentage of Dia that they earn from block rewards with their voters. You can review the value proposals from validators by clicking on their names in the [Block Explorer](https://explorer.nos.io) and reading their descriptions.

* **Contribute to databases:** Validators might **reward** people for contributing to their databases. Check out their descriptions to find out what you can do for a validator to get paid DIA.

* **Add Compendia to your app:** The Compendia team and some validators are giving Dia **grants** to developers who will build or extend apps and websites that integrate with Compendia's APIs. You can join the [Telegram](https://t.me/nOSChat) to present your app.

* **Become a validator:** As a validator you consistently earn block rewards. The top 47 validators earn 3.9 DIA, and the top 5 earn 4.2 DIA.

## Use Cases
Any service that processes databases (meaning: almost any application on the internet) can benefit from Compendia databases.

Examples:
* **App store** where all apps are maintained by users and validators on Compendia.
* **DeFi** (Decentralized Finance) app that pulls cryptocurrency price data from Compendia into a blockchain or smart contract.
* **Video streaming app** that displays trending videos indexed by Compendia databases.
* **Social blogging app** that ranks posts based on the ratings on Compendia databases.
* **News site** where articles and their reliability are validated by various nodes on Compendia.
* **Machine Learning** algorithm that's trained by data on Compendia.
* **Wiki** service that formats and displays encyclopedia-like data of a specific category.


## Adoption
We're still building the tools that allow applications to easily integrate with the network's databases.

The first application to integrate with Compendia is the nOS multi-blockchain wallet app:

| Name                  | Description               | Database |
